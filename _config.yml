  Hello, my name is Alvionna and I'm currently pursuing Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Advanced Computing at Tsinghua University. I am also working as a research assistant at the CoAI (Conversational AI) Laboratory. My research interest lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Moreover, I have a great interest in Finance and currently learning FinTech as a side project. 

  What I am trying to solve: 
  - How to make robot/chatbot talks like us, humans? (not awkwardly and not so robotly :D) 
  - How to make robot/chatbot understand humans emotionally? 
  - How to create a mental health support chatbot that is accessible? 

  I am most skilled in: <mark> NLP, LLM, Deep Learning</mark>, and <mark>Eating Noodles and K-BBQ</mark>
